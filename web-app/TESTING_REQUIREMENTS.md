# TESTING REQUIREMENTS - CRITICAL DOCUMENT

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: These testing requirements are MANDATORY and NON-NEGOTIABLE**

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### GUI Testing is MANDATORY
- **ALL GUI functions must be tested WITHOUT EXCEPTION**
- **100% UI component coverage is REQUIRED**
- **Every user interaction must have a corresponding test**
- **No UI feature can be considered complete without tests**

### Technology Stack (DO NOT CHANGE)
- **E2E/UI Testing:** Playwright (ONLY - no switching to Cypress, Selenium, etc.)
- **Component Testing:** React Testing Library
- **Unit Testing:** Jest
- **NO technology changes without explicit user approval**

### Required Playwright Features
- Visual regression testing (screenshots)
- Multiple browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Mobile device emulation
- Network conditions simulation
- Offline mode testing
- Geolocation testing
- Timezone testing
- Parallel test execution
- Test retries for flaky tests
- HTML test reports
- Video recording for failures
- Trace viewer for debugging

### Test Patterns
```typescript
// Every UI test must follow this pattern
test.describe('Component/Feature Name', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    // Setup
  });

  test('should [action] when [condition]', async ({ page }) => {
    // Arrange
    // Act
    // Assert
  });

  test('should handle [error case]', async ({ page }) => {
    // Test error scenarios
  });

  test('should be accessible', async ({ page }) => {
    // Test accessibility
  });

  test('should work on mobile', async ({ page }) => {
    // Test mobile behavior
  });
});
```

## üìä Test Execution Requirements

### Continuous Integration
- Tests must run on every commit
- Tests must run before merge
- Failing tests block deployment
- Test results must be reported

### Local Development
- Developers must run tests before committing
- Pre-commit hooks for testing
- Fast test execution (< 5 minutes for unit/component)
- Parallel test execution

### Test Commands
```bash
# Unit tests
npm test

# Component tests
npm run test:components

# E2E tests (Playwright)
npm run test:e2e

# All tests
npm run test:all

# Visual regression tests
npm run test:visual

# Accessibility tests
npm run test:a11y

# Coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

## üö´ VIOLATIONS

The following constitute testing violations:

1. **Shipping UI features without tests**
2. **Skipping or disabling tests without documentation**
3. **Changing testing frameworks without explicit approval**
4. **Reducing test coverage below thresholds**
5. **Not testing error cases**
6. **Not testing accessibility**
7. **Not testing responsive design**
8. **Not updating tests when features change**

---

## ‚úÖ Test Review Checklist

Before ANY PR/merge:

- [ ] All new UI components have tests
- [ ] All user interactions are tested
- [ ] All error cases are handled
- [ ] Accessibility tests pass
- [ ] Visual regression tests pass
- [ ] E2E tests cover the full workflow
- [ ] Test coverage meets requirements
- [ ] Tests run in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] No tests are skipped or disabled
- [ ] Documentation updated

## üìö Resources

### Playwright Documentation
- [Official Docs](https://playwright.dev)
- [Best Practices](https://playwright.dev/docs/best-practices)
- [API Reference](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-playwright)

### Testing Best Practices
- Test user behavior, not implementation
- Keep tests independent and isolated
- Use data-testid attributes for reliable selectors
- Mock external dependencies
- Test the happy path and edge cases
- Write descriptive test names
- Keep tests maintainable
